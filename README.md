My web projects showcase

These are some of my projects from college and they showcase my code!

I will not include how to run each of these projects but you can try by running the main file in each project.(Be sure the have the required frameworks)

I still continue to code and will update my BlazorShowcase and NETShowcase repository's when possible.

I've been recently coding a game I've been working on and the two repository's shared above.(I don't work in the main branch of my game)
